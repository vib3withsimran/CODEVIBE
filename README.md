## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16.x or higher
- npm or yarn package manager
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JiyaBatra/CODEVIBE-.git
   cd CODEVIBE-
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Frontend setup
   cd client
   npm install
   
   # Backend setup
   cd ../server
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**

    Copy the environment template and fill in your values:

```bash
    cp server/.env.example server/.env
```

   Then open `server/.env` and update at minimum:
   - `MONGODB_URI` — your local or MongoDB Atlas connection string
   - `JWT_SECRET` — generate a secure key by running:
```bash
   node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

   See [`server/.env.example`](./server/.env.example) for all available
   variables and their descriptions.

### Environment Setup
To run the backend locally, you need to configure your environment variables.

Navigate to the server/ directory.

Copy the .env.example file and rename it to .env.

Update the variables in .env as needed:

PORT: The port your Express server will run on (Default: 5002).

DB_URL / MONGODB_URI: Your MongoDB connection string.

ALLOWED_ORIGINS: Comma-separated list of frontend URLs permitted to access the API.

LEADERBOARD_API_URL & TOKEN: Credentials required if you are syncing GitHub stats with the backend.


4. **Start the development servers**
   
   Terminal 1 - Backend:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   Terminal 2 - Frontend:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open in browser**
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```
